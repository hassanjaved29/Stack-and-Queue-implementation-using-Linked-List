Purpose of the Code

This program implements Stack and Queue data structures using a Linked List in C#. The objective is to:

1.	Show concepts of linked lists, including nodes.

2.	Provide hands-on practice with fundamental data structures.

3.	Illustrate how stacks and queues  work.

Features:

•	Stack Operations: 

o	Push

o	Pop

o	Display

•	Queue Operations: 

o	Enqueue

o	Dequeue

o	Display

 



How to Run the Program

Steps:

1.	Open the project folder in your   IDE.

2.	Compile and run the program using IDE.

 



Time Complexity

Stack:

1.	Push: O(1) – Push is done at the beginning of the linked list.

2.	Pop: O(1) – Pop is done at the beginning of the linked list.

3.	Display: O(n) – It shows the entire list to display elements.

Queue:

1.	Enqueue: O(1) – Enqueu is done at the end of the linked list.

2.	Dequeue: O(1) – Dequeue is done at the start of the linked list.

3.	Display: O(n) – Shows the entire list for display element
